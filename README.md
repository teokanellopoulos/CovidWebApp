# CovidWebApp

This is a simple frontend web app as a project for one of my university's courses. It is built using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
This app offers the user a simple homepage with links to other pages. It has a FAQs page with an accordion design, a page that makes a call to an API to make a dummy appointment,
a page with dummy news, a page that makes a call to an API that retrieves data about Covid-19 vaccinations and displays them to table and finally a page where the user can contact the 
administration of the web app where the AngularJS framework is used for form validation. Finally this page is responsive to all devices.
